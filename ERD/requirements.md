Task 0: Define Entities and Relationships in ER Diagram
Objective

Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to represent the database design for the Airbnb-like application. This diagram should clearly define entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.
Entities and Attributes
1. User

Represents users of the application, including guests, hosts, and admins.

    Attributes:
        user_id (Primary Key, UUID)
        first_name (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)
        last_name (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)
        email (VARCHAR, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
        password_hash (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)
        phone_number (VARCHAR, NULL)
        role (ENUM: guest, host, admin, NOT NULL)
        created_at (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

2. Property

        description (TEXT, NOT NULL)
        location (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)

        start_date (DATE, NOT NULL)
        end_date (DATE, NOT NULL)
        total_price (DECIMAL, NOT NULL)
        status (ENUM: pending, confirmed, canceled, NOT NULL)
        created_at (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

4. Payment

    Attributes:
        payment_id (Primary Key, UUID)
        booking_id (Foreign Key, references Booking.booking_id)
        amount (DECIMAL, NOT NULL)
        payment_date (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
        payment_method (ENUM: credit_card, PayPal, Stripe, NOT NULL)

5. Review

Represents reviews left by users for properties.

    Attributes:
        review_id (Primary Key, UUID)

        rating (INTEGER, CHECK: rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5, NOT NULL)
        comment (TEXT, NOT NULL)
        created_at (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

6. Message

Represents messages exchanged between users.

    Attributes:
        message_id (Primary Key, UUID)
        sender_id (Foreign Key, references User.user_id)
        recipient_id (Foreign Key, references User.user_id)
        message_body (TEXT, NOT NULL)
        sent_at (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

    User to Message
        One user can send multiple messages to another user.
        Relationship: 1:N

ER Diagram
Description

The ER diagram visually represents the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. Use the following guidelines to create the diagram:

    Tools: Use Draw.io, Lucidchart, or any ERD-specific software.
    Represent entities as rectangles.
    Represent relationships as diamonds connecting entities.
    Use lines with cardinalities to show the type of relationship (1:1, 1:N).
