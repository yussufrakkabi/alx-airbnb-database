# Optimization Report

## Initial Query
- Query: [Initial query from perfomance.sql]
- Issues:
  1. Retrieved unnecessary columns.
  2. No filtering condition, leading to large data scans.
  3. Lack of indexes on join conditions.

## Optimized Query
- Query: [Optimized query with indexes and filters]
- Improvements:
  1. Reduced the number of columns retrieved.
  2. Added a filter on the `date` column.
  3. Created indexes on `user_id`, `property_id`, and `booking_id`.

## Performance Comparison
| Metric           | Before Optimization | After Optimization |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Execution Time    | [time]              | [time]             |
| Query Plan Notes  | Seq Scan            | Index Scan         |

## Recommendations
- Ensure indexes are maintained on high-usage columns.
- Regularly review and refactor queries to minimize unnecessary joins.
