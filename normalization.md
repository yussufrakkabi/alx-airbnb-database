Normalization Steps
1. First Normal Form (1NF)

    All columns contain atomic values, with no repeating groups or multi-valued attributes.
    All tables in the schema already meet 1NF.

2. Second Normal Form (2NF)

    Each table is in 1NF.
    All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
    The schema does not contain partial dependencies, so it is in 2NF.

3. Third Normal Form (3NF)

    Each table is in 2NF.
    There are no transitive dependencies between non-key attributes.
    The schema adheres to 3NF, ensuring that all attributes depend only on the primary key.

Conclusion
The database schema is well-designed and already meets the requirements for 3NF. There are no redundancies or unnecessary dependencies.
